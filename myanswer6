Chef is a farmer and a pet lover. He has a lot of his favorite pets cats and dogs in the barn. He does not know their exact count. 
But he knows that there are C cats and D dogs in the barn. 
Also, one day went to field and found that there were L legs of the animals touching the ground. Chef knows that cats love to ride on the dogs. 
So, they might ride on the dogs, and their legs won't touch the ground and Chef would miss counting their legs. 
Chef's dogs are strong enough to ride at max two cats on their back.

It was a cold foggy morning, when Chef did this counting. So he is now wondering whether he counted the legs properly or not. 
Specifically, he is wondering is there a some possibility of his counting being correct. Please help Chef in finding it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    correct_counting = NO;
    if(no_of_legs%4 == 0 && no_of_legs >= 4LL*no_of_dogs && no_of_legs <= 4LL*(no_of_cats + no_of_dogs) && cats_on_back <= 2LL*no_of_dogs)
    {
        correct_counting = YES;
    }

L has to be a multiple of 4, has to count all the dogs at least and can count all the dogs and cats at most.

Each dog can have at most 2 cats on shoulder and although no of dogs is int ... 4*no_of_dogs may not be ... May cause overflow for faulty results
Typecast required.
